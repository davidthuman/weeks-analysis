# Weeks Analysis

This repo contains Python code, CSV files, and figures that come together to show my day-to-day life as a college student.

## Introduction

At the of my junior year of college (Fall 2021) at Cornell University, I decided to track what I do in 15-minute intervals. Tracking all of my data in Notion, which also contains my task organization, I would create week-template that contain my global database of tasks, a to-do list for each day, and a table with rows as 15-minute blocks and with columns as days in the week. Throughout the semester, and even into Spring 2022 and currently Fall 2022, I kept track of all of my actions, whether it be school work, class time, walking, eating, sleep, relaxing, or hanging out with friends; Everything I did was noted. After the Fall 2021 semester, I explored all the tables into CSV files and used Python, with matplotlib and pandas libraries, to catagorize my actions, anaylze them, and then plot to visualize them.
