# Weekly Schedule Analysis

## Introduction

When double majoring in Engineering Physics and Computer Science, while obtaining a minor in Public Policy, TAing an upperclassman math course, and being the Vice President of a fraternity, attention to detail, time management, and organization are the only way to stay afloat.

Most people at least flirt with the idea of creating a planner, schedule, or to-do list. When you become more involved in college, whether that be on the academic, professional, or club level, the amount of tasks that become spreadout among many areas of your life become too much to simply keep track of in your head. This is where a planner becomes essential to the productivity of a person's life.

## Data Collection

I created my planner through an application called Notion. "Notion is a note-taking software platform designed to help members of companies or organizations manage their knowledge for greater efficiency and productivity" (Wikipedia, 2022). However, Notion is not only a note-taking app. It is loaded with a multitude of features and data structures that can be combined in an infinite number of ways. For me, it was used to organize my life, down to level of every 15-minutes.

As was natural to my work process, I decided to look at my life a week at a time. To do this, I created a Week template page that can be created every Monday with a single click. There are three main components to my Week page:

* Global Assignment database
* Daily To-Do list
* Time Schedule

![The global assignment database houses all assignments that need to be completed throughout the semester. Each assignment has an associated name, class, due date, type, weekday, and status. Assignments are sorted by due date and status to push assignments that have upcoming due dates that have not yet been completed. This table-view of the database is present in all Week pages.](./figures/readMe/Notion_Assignments.png "Global Assignment Database")
