### Google Provider Authentication

It appears that I need to configure credentials with Google to allow authentication through them.

Using Google Cloud Console, navigate to the APIs & Services section to create credentials.

You then are asked to configure the OAuth consent screen where you give your app name and other things.

After, you can go to the Credentials section and click Create OAuth client id. You will give it the url that will be requesting the authentication.

This will create a client ID and client secret that will be placed in the .env file in the Next JS app.
